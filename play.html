        <h2>Pericles, Prince of Tyre</h2>

        <h3>SCENE I. Antioch. A room in the palace.</h3>
<blockquote><p><i class="sd"><pre>Enter ANTIOCHUS, Prince PERICLES, and followers</pre></i></p></blockquote>
<h4 class="nm antiochus">ANTIOCHUS</h4>
<blockquote><p class="para"><pre>Young prince of Tyre, you have at large received
The danger of the task you undertake.</pre></p></blockquote>
<h4 class="nm pericles">PERICLES</h4>
<blockquote><p class="para"><pre>I have, Antiochus, and, with a soul
Embolden'd with the glory of her praise,
Think death no hazard in this enterprise.</pre></p></blockquote>
<h4 class="nm antiochus">ANTIOCHUS</h4>
<blockquote><p class="para"><pre>Bring in our daughter, clothed like a bride,
For the embracements even of Jove himself;
At whose conception, till Lucina reign'd,
Nature this dowry gave, to glad her presence,
The senate-house of planets all did sit,
To knit in her their best perfections.

<i class="sd">Music. Enter the Daughter of ANTIOCHUS</i></pre></p></blockquote>

<h4 class="nm pericles">PERICLES</h4>
<blockquote><p class="para"><pre>See where she comes, apparell'd like the spring,
Graces her subjects, and her thoughts the king
Of every virtue gives renown to men!
Her face the book of praises, where is read
Nothing but curious pleasures, as from thence
Sorrow were ever razed and testy wrath
Could never be her mild companion.
You gods that made me man, and sway in love,
That have inflamed desire in my breast
To taste the fruit of yon celestial tree,
Or die in the adventure, be my helps,
As I am son and servant to your will,
To compass such a boundless happiness!</pre></p></blockquote>
<h4 class="nm antiochus">ANTIOCHUS</h4>
<blockquote><p class="para"><pre>Prince Pericles,--</pre></p></blockquote>
<h4 class="nm pericles">PERICLES</h4>
<blockquote><p class="para"><pre>That would be son to great Antiochus.</pre></p></blockquote>
<h4 class="nm antiochus">ANTIOCHUS</h4>
<blockquote><p class="para"><pre>Before thee stands this fair Hesperides,
With golden fruit, but dangerous to be touch'd;
For death-like dragons here affright thee hard:
Her face, like heaven, enticeth thee to view
Her countless glory, which desert must gain;
And which, without desert, because thine eye
Presumes to reach, all thy whole heap must die.
Yon sometimes famous princes, like thyself,
Drawn by report, adventurous by desire,
Tell thee, with speechless tongues and semblance pale,
That without covering, save yon field of stars,
Here they stand martyrs, slain in Cupid's wars;
And with dead cheeks advise thee to desist
For going on death's net, whom none resist.</pre></p></blockquote>
<h4 class="nm pericles">PERICLES</h4>
<blockquote><p class="para"><pre>Antiochus, I thank thee, who hath taught
My frail mortality to know itself,
And by those fearful objects to prepare
This body, like to them, to what I must;
For death remember'd should be like a mirror,
Who tells us life's but breath, to trust it error.
I'll make my will then, and, as sick men do
Who know the world, see heaven, but, feeling woe,
Gripe not at earthly joys as erst they did;
So I bequeath a happy peace to you
And all good men, as every prince should do;
My riches to the earth from whence they came;
But my unspotted fire of love to you.

<i class="sd">To the Daughter of ANTIOCHUS</i>

Thus ready for the way of life or death,
I wait the sharpest blow, Antiochus.</pre></p></blockquote>
